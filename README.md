## Library 
Library with local storage created for The Odin Project ([Project Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)) using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SkeletonCSS and localStorage.
 
 * I learned about object contructors and object manipulation. <br/>
 * Also about localStorage and sessionStorage. <br/>
 * Experienced using SkeletonCSS for the first time. <br/>
 * I also tried to use this project to get more into the ES6 JavaScript syntaxes. <br/>
